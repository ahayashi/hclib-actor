In general, the Actors/Selectors model provides an `exit()` operation to terminate actors/selectors. While it may seem somewhat natural to expose this operation to users, one problem with this termination semantics is that it requires users to ensure that all messages in the incoming mailbox are processed (or received in some cases) before invoking exit, which adds additional complexities even for the simplest kernel. 

To mitigate this burden, we added a relaxed version of `exit()`, which we call `done()`, to enable the runtime do more of the heavy lifting. The semantics of done is that users tell the runtime that the PE on which a specific actor/selector object resides will not send any more messages in the future to a particular mailbox, so the runtime can still keep the corresponding actor/selector alive so it can continue to receive messages and process them.
